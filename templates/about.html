									Sister of Arjun Rajkumar, Krishika, a

									A successful entrepreneur with a restaurant, she was securing places and

									husband, who is a Senior Manager at Bank of America by profession.
									Coming from a family of successful go-getters, it’s obvious when you grow into
									one. By seeing her parents, brother and uncles running a business, she’s learnt
									quite a few tricks as well.
									However, she learnt from her father that innovation is the key to success and
									there is no compromise on quality.
									Currently, she is responsible for the Back office and Administration of the
									organisation.
