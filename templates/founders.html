                    Sister of Arjun Rajkumar, Krishika, a vibrant, talented, and extraordinarily skilled persona, graduated in Business Administration, Diploma in Hotel Management from Hotel Academy Chennai and the house of Days inn. She was credited for having an amazing caliber in management and her hands- on experience in the front office, accounts, production, hospitality, and housekeeping during her internship at ITC Park Sheraton Towers Chennai was unabashedly applauded. She pursued a passion for making chocolates at home and also did a workshop course in chocolate manufacturing at SanFransico USA. Perfection is her middle name, and as thorough and skilled she likes to be in whatever she persists, she decided to carve her professional arc and has taken courses in bakery and confectionery. A successful entrepreneur with a restaurant, she was securing places and marking her business aura before COVID. However, she still has her home bakery unit in the banner of Kichees Delights. She is ably supported by her husband, who is a Senior Manager at Bank of America by profession. Coming from a family of successful go-getters, it’s obvious when you grow into one. By seeing her parents, brother and uncles running a business, she’s learnt quite a few tricks as well. However, she learnt from her father that innovation is the key to success and there is no compromise on quality. Currently, she is responsible for the Back office and Administration of the organisation.
